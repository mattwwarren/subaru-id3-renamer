# subaru-id3-renamer
The Subaru Starlink system does not respect ID3 track numbers. So now you can rename your files so they play in the correct order!

## Note about eyed3
[eyed3](https://github.com/nicfit/eyed3) has a number of open issues with Windows compatibility. This script was developed on Mac OS and tested on Linux but never attempted for Windows. I encourage you to help the library maintainer with Windows issues, if you would like to use this in that environment.
